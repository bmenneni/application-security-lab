	                <h2>Introduction</h2>
	            </div>
	            <p>The application layer uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to access and manage files through a command-and-response message structure. The HTTP protocol uses different methods, the most common being the GET method (which fetches data, usually in the form of HTML documents) and the POST method (which lets you provide data that the web application can use). After sending an HTTP request, you receive an HTTP response message, which gives you information about the attempted transfer using a status code. The HTTP status codes are organized based on the type of status. You have probably encountered some when casually browsing the Internet; for example, a commonly seen HTTP status code is 404 (a type of client-side error, indicated by the starting digit '4'), which is returned when a requested document or resource could not be found at a particular URL.</p>
				<p>A <strong>URL</strong> (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a resource on the Internet. To access a specific resource, you type a specific URL in your <strong>browser</strong> (like Google Chrome), which sends a GET request for that URL. A browser is a type of <strong>client</strong>, which is an application that sends requests to other applications. A client is used to communicate with a <strong>server</strong>, which is an application or computer that waits for a client to intiate a connection to it and then provides information or services to the client. Typically, web applications are hosted on web servers. When you send HTTP requests to use a web application, you send HTTP requests to the server hosting that application, and those HTTP requests are then mapped onto particular functions in the application's logic.</p>
				<p>For example, when you sign up for an account on a social media or e-commerce website, you are likely sending data to a web server through an HTTP POST method. This POST method occurs at a particular URL, like <span class="urlFont">mywebsite.com/register</span>. The web application hosted on the server needs to map the POST request at the URL ending with <span class="urlFont">/register</span> (sometimes called an <strong>endpoint</strong>) to a particular registration service that it implements. The web application likely also has a repository service that is associated with a database, and that database is then updated based on your new account data. Finally, an HTTP response message with a particular status code is sent by the web server back to the client. Thus, a full-stack application (i.e., an application with both a frontend and a backend) will have to deal with security at multiple layers, from the information that is stored and retrieved from the database to the user-facing components like a login screen. The image below provides a simplified depiction of the interaction between a browser and a web application hosted on a server:</p>

				<p>In this lab, you will be introduced to the basics of web application and database security using a demo Java web application. You will learn about authentication and authorization in web applications, password encoding in databases, and how to examine the logs of a web application to identify security events of potential interest, which is a valuable skill in network security as well as application debugging. By the end of this lab, you should hopefully have a better appreciation of how web applications and databases need to manage their security needs.</p>

	                <h2>User Authentication</h2>
	            </div>
				<div class="subHeader">Overview of Authentication</div>
	            <p><strong>Authentication</strong> refers to the process of determining whether a user is actually who they claim to be. Usually, authentication involves challenging
				the user to provide some kind of credentials, which can then be validated by a backend (not visible to the user). Authentication is usually the first thing that a user has to do if they want to access an application, because it would be difficult to implement any kind of effective access control (i.e., determining what and how a user accesses resources on your application) without first validating the user's credentials.</p>
				<p>The most common kind of authentication method is using a password that has a one-to-one relationship with a unique username or user ID. This is a form of knowledge-based authentication (KBA), as it is based on secret knowledge that only the user should know. Using passwords to secure applications is ubiquitous on the web, and is favored due to its convenience and ease of implementation. For many websites, it is the only form of authentication implemented. Other types of authentication methods include possession-based authentication methods, which are based on something a user controls (like an email address), and biometric-based authentication methods, which are based on something that uniquely identifies the human user. The latter are becoming increasingly common for securing physical devices, such as in the case of fingerprint readers for laptops and mobile phones. However, biometric-based methods are not typically used to secure web applications.</p>
				<p>The demo web application used in this lab will take a closer look at using passwords for authentication. To access the web application, navigate to the following URL on your browser: <a href="https://security-demo-app.onrender.com/login.html" target="_blank">Link</a>.</p>
				<br>
				<div class="subHeader">Using the Demo Web Application</div>
				<p>When you arrive at the application page, you should see be greeted with a login screen. You should see <span class="urlFont">/login.html</span> in the endpoint of the URL. Click the "Register new account" button to go the registration page. On the registration page (which has the URL endpoint <span class="urlFont">/register.html</span>), fill out the form with a username and password of your choice. This will update the database on the backend with an HTTP POST request containing your new account data. If the registration was successful, you will be taken to a page with the URL endpoint <span class="urlFont">/good-registration</span> and a success message. Now, return to the login screen and try signing in with your chosen user credentials. If unsuccessful, you will see a red error message below the form. If successful, you will be authenticated and taken to a page with the URL endpoint <span class="urlFont">/good-login</span>. It should look something like the figure shown below.</p>
	            <div class="image-container">
					<figure>
						<img src="goodLogin.png" alt="LoginImage">
						<figcaption class="caption"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Good login page of the demo web application.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>You can't access the <span class="urlFont">/good-login</span> endpoint unless you are an authenticated user. You can try opening a new private or incognito browsing window and try accessing the <span class="urlFont">/good-login</span> endpoint. If you do, you should be redirected to the <span class="urlFont">/login.html</span> endpoint. Under the hood, the web application has a security configuration class file written in Java that grants unauthenticated users access to only a handful of URLs, namely those associated with logging in and registering new accounts.</p>
				<p>On the successful login page, you should see text that identifies your User Role as a regular user, and the username that you chose during registration. Your username is being found using a <span class="code">findByUsername()</span> method in the Java code that takes your inputted username and password as parameters. The method searches the database for your username, and if it finds a match, it returns the entire User object with all associated fields. Then, the application compares the password you entered with the password string associated with your username in the database. If the passwords match, the login is successful, and you are an authenticated user. The passwords in the database are not stored in plain text, however. We will look more closely at this later in the lab.</p>
				<p>It is important to note that during the process of registration, we have already stumbled upon a potential security vulnerability in the application. In the regular HTTP protocol, the POST requests that you send to the application both during registration and login are totally unencrypted. That means an attacker could sniff the HTTP packets and see your password in plain text! For this reason, real-life applications that need to implement secure user authentication always use HTTPS, which is a file transfer protocol that uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt transmitted data and protect it from sniffing attacks. HTTPS uses the same methods (like GET and POST) as the regular HTTP protocol, so it can be considered a secure extension of HTTP rather than an entirely different protocol. Today, HTTPS is used by almost all websites.</p>
				<p>Take a screenshot of the successful login page, making sure that the URL and your username are visible. Next, we will look at how authorization and access control can be implemented in the web application.</p>
	        </div>
	        <div id="page3" class="page">
	            <div class="pageHeader">
	                <h2>Authorization and Access Control</h2>
	            </div>
				<div class="subHeader">User Authorization</div>
	            <p><strong>Authorization</strong> refers to the process of determining what resources a user should have access to. It is a form of <strong>access control</strong>. Typically, authorization is done after authentication and is a distinct process, through it often relies on the user credentials validated during the authentication process. In web applications, a common way of implementing authorization is by assigning different roles to user accounts. In the demo web application, every new user that registers an account is automatically assigned a role of "regular user" using a setter method (i.e., <span class="code">newUser.setRole("reg_user")</span>). Thus, every newly registered user in the database has a value <span class="code">reg_user</span> in their user role field. There is also an <span class="code">admin</span> user role that grants more access privileges, but the web application does not support creating new accounts with the <span class="code">admin</span> user role.</p> 
				<p>These user roles are used in the Java application's security configuration file to control access to different endpoints. Users with the regular user role can only access the link with endpoint <span class="urlFont">/public-info</span>. If you are logged into the web application with your user account, try clicking on the Public Info link on the Good Login page. You should be able to access the Public Info page.</p>
				<p>However, there is also a page for admins only. Try clicking on that link from the Good Login page. Since your user role is only that of a regular user, you are denied access to the URL endpoint <span class="urlFont">/admin-only</span> and are instead redirected to a page with the URL endpoint <span class="urlFont">/access-denied</span>. This means that the HTTP GET request that you sent to the <span class="urlFont">/admin-only</span> endpoint was unsuccessful, and an HTTP packet was sent back with the response code 403, indicating a type of client-side error where the requested resource is not allowed. Under the hood, the Java application is using the method <span class="code">hasAuthority("admin")</span> to specify which URLs can be accessed exclusively by users with a particular authorization (represented by their user role). You can pass different user roles as parameters in the method to structure your application's access control mechanism.</p>
				<p>Now, let's try logging in as admin. Click on the "Login as different user" link, or navigate back to the login.html page. Type <strong>admin</strong> in the username field and <strong>cpre530</strong> in the password field. This time, when you arrive at the Good Login page, your User Role should be Admin. Try clicking on the Admins Only link now. You should be able to access the endpoint, and find two things that probably shouldn't be exposed in a real-life application: a link to download the application's database, and another link to download the application's log file. For now, click on the first link to download the database. You should get a file called "securitydemo.db". We will use that file in the next section of the lab.</p>
				<br>
				<div class="subHeader">Access Control with HTTP Headers</div>
				<p>In addition to implementing access control with user authorization, you can also implement access control using the headers of the HTTP protocol. This might be useful if you want a particular resource to only be accessed by clicking a link on a specific page, rather than simply navigating to the URL. For example, in the Admin Page of the demo web application, clicking on the link to download a database sends a GET request to the URL endpoint <span class="urlFont">/download-db</span>. Similarly, clicking the link to download the log file sends a GET request to <span class="urlFont">/download-log</span>. You might not want these endpoints to be accessible from any other place except from the links in the Admin Page. To implement this, you can look at a particular request header of the HTTP protocol called <span class="code">Referer</span> (that's not a typo - the header was misspelled in the original proposal, and the misspelling stuck around). The <span class="code">Referer</span> request header identifies the address of the web page from which a resource is being requested, so you can implement conditional logic in your backend to deny access to a certain endpoint unless it has a valid referrer.</p>
				<p>Here's an example of Java code in the demo web application that grabs the HTTP <span class="code">Referer</span> header and carries out basic control flow:
				<div>
					<pre>
					String referrer = request.getHeader("Referer");
					if (referrer == null || !referrer.endsWith("/admin-only")) {
						return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN).body("403 Forbidden");
					}
					</pre>
				</div>
				<p>This code returns an HTTP <span class="code">ResponseEntity</span> object for the GET endpoint at <span class="urlFont">/download-db</span>. Unless the referrer in the HTTP header has the endpoint <span class="urlFont">/admin-only</span>, which is the URL endpoint of the Admin Page, an HTTP 403 Forbidden error is returned. The diagram below shows the basic idea behind implementing access control using HTTP referrers:</p>
	            <div class="image-container">
					<figure>
						<img src="referrer-403.png" alt="ReferrerImage">
						<figcaption class="caption"><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Access Control using HTTP Referrers</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>If you are logged into the demo web application as Admin, try accessing the <span class="urlFont">/download-db</span> endpoint by typing the URL into your browser instead of clicking on the Link in the Admin Page. This time, you should get a 403 Forbidden error despite having proper authorization to access <span class="urlFont">/download-db</span>. Another example where access control with HTTP referrers is used is the <span class="urlFont">/good-registration</span> endpoint, which is only accessible after you have registered a new user account using the registration form. Thus, by using the referrer headers of the HTTP protocol, you can implement tighter and more refined access control in your web application so that certain URLs can't be accessed in invalid or inappropriate contexts.</p>

					<h2>Databases and Password Encoding</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="subHeader">Using Databases in Web Applications</div>
				<p>A <strong>database</strong> is an organized collection of data that can be accessed and updated by applications. The most common types of databases are relational databases, which can organize data into multiple different tables that have relationships with each other (like a Customer table and an Order table). Real-life web applications often use relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL and PostgreSQL to manage their data needs. The databases that these applications use will typically need to be hosted on their own dedicated database servers, or using cloud services like AWS (Amazon Web Services).</p>
				<p>For the purposes of this lab, we are using a lightweight relational database called <strong>SQLite</strong>. Unlike the common RDBMS systems, SQLite doesn’t need a dedicated database server; you can deploy the entire database used by your application on a single lightweight file! This makes it excellent for mobile applications as well as for demonstration purposes. The database file we will use in the lab is the securitydemo.db file, which you should have downloaded from the Admin Page in the previous section.</p>
				<p>You can use DB Browser, an open source and easy-to-use database visualization tool, to examine and modify .db files. Download DB Browser for SQLite here: <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/" target="_blank">https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/</a></p>
				<p>Launch DB Browser once you have downloaded it. Click the “Open Database” button circled in red in the figure below, then navigate to the directory where you downloaded the securitydemo.db file and open it. If the database opened correctly, you should see the tables in the “Database Structure” tab as shown below:</p>
				<div class="image-container">
					<figure>
						<img src="dbBrowser1.png" alt="dbBrowserImage1">
						<figcaption class="caption"><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Open Database and View Database Structure in DB Browser</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>If you click on the individual tables like <strong>accounts</strong>, you can see the different columns that define the table. Now, click on the “Browse Data” tab to see the data stored in the accounts table. It should look something like this:</p>
				<div class="image-container">
					<figure>
						<img src="dbBrowser2.png" alt="dbBrowserImage2">
						<figcaption class="caption"><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Browse Data in User Accounts table in DB Browser</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>The <strong>accounts</strong> table has four columns: user_id (which is incremented automatically), username, password, and role. There are two roles defined in the database, <span class="code">admin</span> and <span class="code">reg_user</span>, as we discussed in the previous section. As we can see, there is only one admin account. The username can be any string, provided they are unique in the database. You should also see the username that you registered your account with in the database table, and the row representing your user should have the value <span class="code">reg_user</span> in the role field. But what is going on with the password fields? Why are they displayed as a long string of seemingly random characters?</p>
				<br>
				<div class="subHeader">Password Encoding</div>
				<p>For security reasons, you should never store plain text passwords in a database. Passwords stored in a database should always be encoded, which typically involves using a <strong>hash function</strong> to take an input of arbitrary length and convert it into a fixed-length data element. Unlike regular encryption, hash functions are one-way functions, meaning that knowing the output does not tell you the input (i.e., the real password). There might be many different inputs that produce the same output. Thus, even if a hacker got access to the database, the strings they see in the password fields would not tell them what the actual passwords are.</p>
				<p>A hash function is used to encode the password that is submitted in plain text (such as during an account registration process), and that encoded string is stored in a password file, which is usually associated with a database (or is part of the database itself). Then, during the authentication process, the hash function is once again applied to the submitted plain text password, and the value is compared to the value stored in the password file that is associated with the username that is undergoing authentication. If the comparison checks out, the user is successfully authenticated. The diagram below outlines the basic process of using hash functions to create and check passwords:</p>
				<div class="image-container">
					<figure>
						<img src="hashFunction.png" alt="hashFunctionImage">
						<figcaption class="caption"><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Using a hash function in password-based authentication. From Jacobson (2008: 446)</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>The hashing algorithm used by the demo web application is called <strong>bcrypt</strong>, which is supported by the Spring Security framework for Java applications. The bcrypt algorithm involves both hashing the input value and <strong>salting</strong>, which is a process of feeding randomly generated data as an additional input to the one-way hash function. In bcrypt, the generated strings have a total length of 60 characters, of which 53 characters are the encoded value (31 characters for the hash output and 22 characters for the additional salt). The first 4 characters of the string is the algorithm code that tells the application what hashing algorithm is being used. For bcrypt, the algorithm codes are in the format <span class="code">$2x$</span>, where <span class="code">x</span> is a variable that can have different character values. If you look at the encoded strings in the database password fields, you can identify them as bcrypt encoded strings based on their initial 4 characters. The process of generating bcrypt encoded strings is shown in the diagram below:</p>
				
				<div class="image-container">
					<figure>
						<img src="bcrypt.png" alt="bcryptImage">
						<figcaption class="caption"><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Using bcrypt to encode a password string. From Batubara, et al. (2021: 2)</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				
				<p>Although it is pretty much impossible to guess a password from the bcrypt encoded string, if you know your password you can verify that it matches the encoded string. Try it out yourself by going to <a href="https://bcrypt.online/" target="_blank">Bcrypt Online</a>. Under the Bcrypt Hash Verifier section, enter your plain text password (the one you used to register with) in the plain text field, and paste the corresponding encoded string from the database password field into the hash field. Take a screenshot showing the successful matching.</p>			
				<p>By using password encoding as well as the HTTPS protocol discussed earlier, the password that you use for your user account shouldn't be visible to anyone except yourself, neither from the payload of network packets sent during the authentication process nor from values stored in a password file or user database. Even the admin of the website, or whoever has control of the user account data, would not know what your actual password is.</p>

					<h2>Looking at Logs</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="subHeader">Overview of Logs</div>
				<p>Log files are a broad category of files that store records about events occurring within a system or particular application. They can be used for application debugging, network security, and general monitoring of user activity. In the context of web application security, the most important logs are server logs that record information about incoming HTTP requests (e.g., GET or POST requests) and authentication logs that record information like failed login attempts or attempts to access unauthorized resources.</p>
				<p>Login to the demo web application as Admin if you aren't currently logged in. Navigate to the Admin Page, and click the link to download the log file. The file should be named <span class="code">securitydemo.log</span>. You can open the log file using any text editor, like Notepad. In it, you should see a historical record of various events relevant to the application. For our purposes, we are interested in seeing security events that are recorded in the log. Note that not all security events necessarily have to be malicious events. Sometimes, you want to have information on various events (like the time and date that a new user was registered) for a broader security context, not necessarily because you are worried about someone trying to hack your application.</p>
				<p>Look through the log file and try to identify noteworthy security events since you started to use the application. You can also try playing around with some different user actions. To identify relevant security events, look for records that include the names <span class="code">LoginAttemptService</span>, <span class="code">UserService</span>, and <span class="code">SecurityConfig</span>, as these are the Java classes that have code for logging important events (the names of these classes should also give you a clue about what kinds of events they log). Try to identify as many relevant security events in the log that you can, and record them.</p>
				<br>
				<div class="subHeader">Logging and Blocking IPs</div>
				<p>One of the ways that you can use logs in web applications is to record the IP addresses of users, as you might have noticed while examining the <span class="code">securitydemo.log</span> file. If a particular user is identified as a bad actor, you might implement some kind of blocking mechanism that denies him or her access to your application. Many online applications have utilities that allow IP addresses to be blocked, like Wordfence (a security plugin for the popular content management system WordPress). To implement an IP ban, there needs to be some kind of filter sitting between the client's browser and the web application's content that has a ruleset defining whether a connection to the application from the client is to be allowed or not. If a user has been banned from accessing a website, they might encounter a page like the one shown below when attempting to access the website:</p>

				<p>IP bans are not as effective as they might seem. IP addresses are usually dynamic, and a user seldom retains the same IP address for long. With modern technology, it is also trivial to change your apparent IP address using applications like web proxy servers, which ensure that the source IP address of a user is that of the proxy. A user may also use public computers, like those at a public library, that are shared by many other users. Indeed, implementing IP bans can come at a severe cost as they might inadvertently ban many legitimate users, especially if many servers are grouped behind a single public IP address. Instead of banning a single IP address, you might look at banning an entire range of IP addresses associated with a particular geographic region if you have many bad actors from a particular geographic region posing a problem for your website. But once again, this has a severe downside of banning many potential users of your application, and such an action might also be perceived as discriminatory.</p>
				<p>Instead of implementing IP bans, better ways to filter and control user activity might be based on user behavior and gradual granting of user privileges as they prove themselves to be trustworthy. For example, if you have a blogging website that is dealing with lots of spam, you might prevent a newly registered user from commenting on your posts until they have been a user for a certain number of days or done a certain number of positive actions (like upvoting other posts). The exact implementation of such controls will vary depending on the particular needs of your application.</p>

					<h2>Analysis and Further Exploration</h2>
				</div>
				<p>Using the knowledge gained from this lab and reputable online resources, try answering the following questions:</p>
				<p>1. In this lab, we discussed access control with both user authorization and HTTP referrers. Imagine if a web application's endpoints for downloading resources are protected by HTTP referrer validation so that they can be only accessed from links on a particular page. The page that contains the download links is protected by user authentication and authorization, but the download endpoints themselves are not. How might this pose a security vulnerability? Would the same vulnerability also apply to the demo web application used in the lab?</p>
				<p>2. In network security, attacks can be classified into four categories based on how they exploit vulnerabilities: header-based, protocol-based, authentication-based, and traffic-based. To learn more about this taxonomy, you can review Dr. Doug Jacobson's summary of the four types of vulnerabilities and attacks <a target="_blank" href="network-security-taxonomy.pdf">here</a>. Based on your answer to the previous question, how would you classify the vulnerability and corresponding attack according to the taxonomy?</p>
				<p>3. We discussed using logs for detecting authentication-based attacks, like a brute force attack on a user's credentials. Without going into too much detail on implementation, briefly describe how you might use logs for detecting traffic-based attacks, and how you might design protections against such attacks using information from logs.</p>
				<p>4. Imagine you are a hacker and you got access to the database file used by the demo web application, but not the application itself. How would you modify the database file so that you can login to the web application as a user with the role admin? Be specific and clearly explain every step you would take after getting control of the database. (Note: It is not possible to login as a user if that user's password field is not a bcrypt encoded string, as the Java application is expecting the password to be encoded in bcrypt)</p>
				<p>5. Relational databases can be modified using Structured Query Language (SQL). Do research on how SQL works. Then, based on your answer to the previous question, write an SQL query that you could use to hack the application and login as an admin user.</p>
